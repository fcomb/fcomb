# fcomb

Tasks:

* Microservice resource (register, settings, stats, api proxy/gateway)
* Integrate Stripe API
* AWS tokens/sign in
* User API token for calling RPC from microservices
* API proxy and router
* Billing and realtime prediction of user balance
* Directory of microservices API
* Search of microservices API



## Ideas

* Own page for comb with custom domain (like gumroad or github pages)
* Event bus with pub/sub - microservice received email then subscriber read it and do trigger another event

http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html:

* Reduces the number of requests/roundtrips. For example, the API gateway enables clients to retrieve data from multiple services with a single round-trip. Fewer requests also means less overhead and improves the user experience. An API gateway is essential for mobile applications.
* Simplifies the client by moving logic for calling multiple services from the client to API gateway
* Generate forms for data input as a page with completed API - like gumroad, microservice became into standalone page with form for data input (like image uploading) and give results back immediately or after payment. In future versions this can allow biologiest to run complex calculations in just single click. This is wolfram language for anything.


## Services to copy

* runscope.com



## Pros

* GPL library as a microservice (cryptolib for example) can be used in closed source product without sharing the code!
